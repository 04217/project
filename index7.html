                <p class="text-dark">Tata Motors was founded in 1945, as a locomotive manufacturer. Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany in which Tata developed a manufacturing facility in Jamshedpur for Daimler lorries.[11] By the November of 1954 Tata and Daimler manufactured their first goods carrier chassis at their Jamshedpur plant with 90-100 hp and capacity of 3-5 tons.After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a sport utility vehicle based on the Tata Mobile platform. Tata subsequently launched the Tata Estate (1992; a station wagon design based on the earlier Tata Mobile), the Tata Sumo (1994, a 5-door SUV) and the Tata Safari (1998).</p>
                <p class="text-dark">Tata launched the Indica in 1998. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, later appeared. Tata Motors also exported cars to South Africa.

                    In the 2000s, Tata Motors made a series of acquisitions and partnerships, acquiring Daewoo's South Korea-based truck manufacturing unit, a joint venture with the Brazil-based Marcopolo, Tata Marcopolo Bus,Jaguar Land Rover.,Hispano Carrocera, and an 80% stake in the Italian design and engineering company Trilix.</p>

                <p class="text-dark">JD Power, of the US, rates Land Rover and Jaguar as the two worst brands for initial quality. [37] The Jaguar F-Pace made Consumer Reports February 2019 list of the 10 Least Reliable Cars. The editors cited "electronics, drive system, power equipment, noises and leaks" as problematic aspects.[38]

                    The Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary was struggling by 2019 and Tata Motors wrote down its investment in JLR by $3.9 billion. Much of the financial problem was due to a 50% drop in sales in China during 2019, although the situation was improving. Still, Tata was open to considering a partnership with another company according to a statement in mid-October, as long as the partnership agreement would allow Tata to maintain control of the business. The company ruled out the possibility of a sale of JLR to another entity.</p>
                <p class="text-dark">In July 2023, Tata announced the its plans to build an electric car battery factory in the UK, which will be one of the largest of its kind in Europe.[40][41] Located in Bridgwater, Somerset, the factory will supply Jaguar Land Rover's future battery electric models, including the Range Rover, Defender, Discovery and Jaguar brands, with the potential to also supply other car manufacturers.[42] Production at the new facility is due to start in 2026.</p>
