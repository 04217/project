            <p class="text-dark">The Coca-Cola Company (KO) is the world’s largest beverage distributer, and through brands like Coke, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite, it delivers over 3% of all drinks consumed globally every day. Starting with just one product in 1886, the Coca-Cola Company has grown to include more than 3800 brands across the world.  
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">Coca-Cola started in 1886, when pharmacist John Pemberton created a caramel-coloured liquid and combined it with carbonated water.

                The rights to the formula were bought in 1888 by businessman Asa Griggs Candler for just $2,300, and the Coca-Cola Company (KO) was subsequently incorporated in 1892. Coca-Cola was first sold from fountains for 5 cents (3p) a glass, and by 1913, one out of every nine Americans had tried it.
                
                As competition began entering the market, Candler sold the rights to bottle Coca-Cola – this launched ‘the Coca-Cola system’, a franchise partnership that now exists between the company and more than 250 bottlers worldwide.
                
                In 1916, the signature Coca-Cola contour bottle was introduced to prevent the real drink being confused with copycats – 100 years later and it is instantly recognisable around the world. 
                
                </p>

    </div>
    <div class="row mb-3">
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <p class="text-dark"> In 1919, a group of businessmen led by Ernest Woodruff purchased The Coca-Cola Company from Candler for $25 million. Later that year, Coca-Cola made its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for $40 per share.

                As of the 2016 annual report, Coca-Cola shares have risen so that the company’s market capitalization is roughly $180 billion, and has had 53 consecutive dividend increases. At the end of 2015, one share of KO stock purchased in 1919 (with dividends reinvested) would have been worth $12,748,802, an annual growth rate of 14.11%.

            <div class="col-12">
            <p class="text-dark">Just one year after Coca-Cola’s IPO, the company had amassed $40 million in assets, and by 1929, the company had sold nearly 27 million gallons of syrup, up 150% from 1920.

                But then on October 24 1929, the Wall Street Crash launched America into a decade-long economic downturn.
                
                Despite declines in sales, Coca-Cola had dedicated themselves to long-term brand equity by continuing to increase advertising costs. This resulted in unparalleled consumer loyalty, despite depreciating stock value, and enabled Coca-Cola to emerge from the economic crisis relatively strong.
                
                This performance helped Coca-Cola join the Dow Jones Industrial Average– which measures the performance of 30 significant US stocks – in 1932, though it was removed in 1935.</p>

            </h1>
            <p class="text-dark">When the US entered World War II, Coca-Cola decided that their product should be available to all deployed soldiers, wherever they were. This created a global demand for the drink, causing the number of countries with bottling facilities to nearly double from the mid-1940s to the 1960s.

                Coca-Cola also introduced its second drink, Fanta, to German markets during this time. Fanta is now consumed more than 130 million times every day.

            <h5 class="text-center">Minute Maid acquisition
            </h5>
            <p class="text-dark">The purchasing of the Minute Maid Corporation, through a stock swap in 1960, marked Coca-Cola’s first venture outside of soft drinks.

                Following the success of this acquisition, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite in 1961, which is now worth an estimated $5 billion, and is the third-most popular soft drink worldwide.

            </h5>
            <p class="text-dark">In July 1982, Coca-Cola introduced a low calorie option, Diet Coke – it was the first new brand to use the Coca-Cola trademark since 1886.

                Within a year of its launch, Diet Coke had become America’s top sugar-free beverage, and had boosted Coca-Cola’s retail sales by 7%. Diet Coke has continued to be one of the most successful brands around the world, available in more than 185 markets.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12">
                <p class="text-center">When rival company Pepsi-Cola began to gain market share in the early 1980s, Coca-Cola announced that, for the first time in 99 years, it would be replacing its formula. On April 23, 1985, original Coke was discontinued, and Coca-Cola shares quickly dropped 3%.
                In 2017, Forbes ranked Coca-Cola as one of the top five most valuable brands worldwide. A large part of that success comes from its marketing campaigns, which have reached all corners of the globe.

                For example, Coca-Cola saw a 2% rise in sales when they launched ‘Share a Coke’, the personalized bottle campaign in 2013.  

                Through advertising campaigns, and sponsorship of sporting events (like the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games), Coca-Cola have made sure that whatever the consumer trend of the era, they have maintained a high public profile.

            <p class="text-center">In 2017, Coca-Cola introduced a new formula for Coke Zero, alongside new packaging and an active marketing campaign, to the UK.

                This resulted in double digit growth and the introduction of the product to markets around the world
