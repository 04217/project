            <p class="text-dark"> Sabyasachi comes from a middle-class Bengali Brahmin family. Around 1947, his parents emigrated to India from what was then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).[4] Sabyasachi is originally from Kakinara, West Bengal. His early education was from Sri Aurobindo Vidyamandir, Chandannagar.

            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">During the summer of 1999, Sabyasachi Mukerjee graduated from the National Institute of Fashion Technology India. Four months later, he started his eponymous which began with a workforce of three people. In 2001, he won the Femina British Council’s most outstanding young Designer of India award, which took him to London for an internship with Georgina von Etzdorf, an eclectic designer based in Salisbury. Returning home with ideas, Sabyasachi started retailing at all major stores in India.</p>
            <p class="text-dark">In 2002, Sabyasachi Mukerjee participated at the India Fashion Week which got positive feedbacks from the press. During the spring of 2003, he made his first international runway, with the "Grand Winner Award" at the Mercedes Benz New Asia Fashion week in Singapore, which paved his way to a workshop in Paris by Jean Paul Gaultier and Azzedine Alaia. In his collection "Kora" at the Lakme Fashion Week 2003, he used unbleached and hand woven fabrics with Kantha and other hand embroideries.

            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">In 2004, Sabyasachi took a step ahead with Kuala Lumpur Fashion Week and The Miami Fashion Week[6] with a bohemian take on Indian textiles and his collection was called "The Frog Princess". His significant achievements included his coveted showing in Browns earning him a retail place at the tiny London store voted by Vogue as the best shopping destination in the world, thereby establishing himself as one of the most promising young designers for years to come.

            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">In 2005, his spring-summer collection, "The Nair Sisters" was inspired by hand block printing, embroideries, bagru prints and the extensive use of cotton and other hand woven fabrics. The collection was sold at Browns & Selfridges in London. He was requested to showcase his collections at the prestigious Oxford University annual black tie charity dinner fashion show.

            <p class="text-dark">2006, Sabyasachi’s debut Spring Summer collection’07 at New York Fashion Week earned him critical acclaim and his label started selling world-wide. The essence of this collection was based on folklore, glamour, simplicity, modern architecture and intricate detailing. There was a marked influence of paintings from the seventeenth and eighteenth century like Brueghel, Claude Monet and others. He used dark jeweled colors with muted shades accentuated with subtle texturing and indigenous embroidery. He is the only Indian designer to be a part of all three leading fashion weeks: New York, Milan and London. Sabyasachi believes that the unique positioning of Indian designers is due to the exclusivity of his homeland with its rich history and culture. He believes that Indian designers bring a flavor to the west that is no longer perceived as only exotic but also a rich blend of individuality and sensitivity.

            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">2007, Sabyasachi participated at the New York and at the London Fashion Weeks plus Bridal Asia 2007, Lakme Fashion Week and the Vogue launch event in India.

            <p class="text-dark">Sabyasachi closed the third edition of PCJ Delhi Couture Week (8–12 August 2012) with his New Moon collection inspired by the flavours of five cities of the world- straitjacket discipline of New York, the nostalgia of the British Raj in Kolkata, the subversive decadence of Berlin, the romanticism of Paris and bohemian flair of Barcelona. Bollywood star Sridevi was the showstopper & walked the ramp for the designer in a sari. The designer is showcasing this collection in UAE as well.Sabyasachi launched in 2008 a line of jewelry exclusively designed by himself, in association with the GAJA brand. The collection was showcased at the Vogue Wedding Show 2016. He launched his exclusive menswear collection featuring Sherwanis, Kurtas and headgear at the Lakme Fashion Week Spring Summer 09 Grand Finale show. He also started a kids wear line under the label Chota Sabhya.

             <p class="text-dark">In 2012, the designer styled a calendar for which Bollywood actress Neha Dhupia dressed up as famous painter Frida Kahlo, who has been the designer's inspiration for the Grand Finale at WIFW Autumn-Winter 2011 where the models walked the ramp wearing Frida Kahlo-esque rose headbands and wire-rimmed glasses.

             </p>
             <p class="text-dark">Sabyasachi Mukherjee's Autumn Winter 2015 collection at Amazon India Couture Week (AICW) was a collaboration with French luxury footwear and fashion designer Christian Louboutin. 80 pairs of shoes, both for men and women, all embroidered with the quintessential Sabyasachi embroidery and embellished with hand-placed sequins, were created for the show. Louboutin also modified his signature Victoria heel for the collection, to be embroidered with the signature Sabyasachi embroidery using acid dyed burnt zardozi and vintage Parsi gara. The designer has exclusively collaborated with Bergdorf Goodman New York for handcrafted pieces of fine and bohemian jewellery during January to March 2020.[17] His palatial estate in Alipore Calcutta was partly inspired from works of Bijoy Jain and Pierre Cardin.

        <p class="text-center text-dark fs-6">Crowded narrow lanes with balconies jutting out of beautiful old mansions and homes, jostling for space in North Calcutta. So rich in its nonchalance, between the clamour of grandeur and decay. It’s almost spiritual, the neglect of luxury and the casual existence of glamour. It makes Calcutta unforgettable.”
